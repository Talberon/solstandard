    <h1>Sol Standard</h1>
    <p>
      Sol Standard is a PVP-focused turn-based tactics game that pits two players against each other in the pursuit of
      tactical supremacy!
      There are 12 distinct unit classes with their own unique abilities available, as well as computer-controlled
      monsters that add a wrinkle to the scenario.
      Plenty of items and interactable environments allow for different gameplay experiences on different battle maps,
      and many maps have randomized elements to keep maps replayable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single player maps are also included so that you can play on your own, and practice for playing against your
      friends!
