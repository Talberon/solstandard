# Sol Standard

Check out the project website for media, Discord and credits! https://solstandard.talberon.com/

Sol Standard is a competitive tactics game that focuses on allowing players to outmaneuver and outsmart their opponents! There are various units with unique abilities that you can command to achieve victory, each with their own playstyle and synergies with other units. There are lots of multiplayer maps to play with your friends, or you can check out one of the solo maps for some practice.

Each map has various items, AI-controlled monsters and interactable objects that you can leverage to gain the advantage over your foes. Draft your army and form a composition that fits your own playstyle, whether it's super fast and deadly, or strong and stable, and anywhere inbetween.

Keyboard and Gamepads are both supported and the interface will dynamically update based on whichever one you are using. Xbox controllers work best, and you can use a different controller for each player. The keyboard can control both players as well if you want to trade off or play against yourself. Netplay is also available; be sure to port forward if hosting a match over the internet.

# Prerequisites

If you try to launch the game and it does not open, it is likely because you may be missing the .NET Core 3.0 runtime. 

Install the runtime for your operating system at the following URL:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0

After installing, try to launch the game again.

If you are still stuck, send an email to bugs.solstandard@gmail.com or ask a question on the Discord server @ https://discord.gg/B94vWYR on the `#bug-reports` channel.

## Project Info
Sol Standard started as a rewrite of [@Talberon](https://github.com/Talberon)'s Ars Tactica project before dropping the original project to rebuild it in a cleaner structure and with newer tools. This project is written in C# using Monogame; an open-source continuation of Microsoft's XNA Framework. The project currently runs on .NET Framework 4.7.1, but may be updated to .NET Core in the future.
