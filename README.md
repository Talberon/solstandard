# Sol Standard
Sol Standard is a tactical strategy game that pits two players against each other in the pursuit of victory! There are several classes of units available, as well as computer-controlled monsters. Plenty of items and interactable tiles allow for vastly different gameplay experiences on different battle maps.

## Project Info
Sol Standard started as a continuation of [@Talberon](https://github.com/Talberon)'s Ars Tactica project before dropping the project entirely to rebuild it in a cleaner project structure. The project is written in C# using the Monogame framework; an open-source continuation of Microsoft's XNA Framework. The project currently runs on .NET Framework 4.7.1, but may be updated to .NET Core in the future.
