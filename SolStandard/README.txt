=BEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME=

If you try to launch the game and it does not open, it is likely because you may be missing the .NET Core 3.0 runtime. 

Install the runtime for your operating system at the following URL:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0

After installing, try to launch the game again.
